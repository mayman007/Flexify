## Contributing

We welcome contributions to make Flexify even better! Here are the ways you can help:

### üåç Translation Contributions

Help us make Flexify accessible to more people by adding your language or improving existing translations.

#### Adding a New Language

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine
2. **Navigate to the translations folder**: `assets/translations/`
3. **Create a new JSON file** for your language using the ISO 639-1 language code (e.g., `fr.json` for French, `es.json` for Spanish)
4. **Copy the structure** from `en.json` and translate all the values to your language
5. **Update the main.dart file** to include your language:
   ```dart
   supportedLocales: [Locale('en'), Locale('ar'), Locale('your_language_code')],
   ```
6. **Test your translation** by running the app and switching to your language
7. **Submit a pull request** with your translation

#### Improving Existing Translations

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine
2. **Navigate to the translations folder**: `assets/translations/`
3. **Edit the appropriate JSON file** (e.g., `ar.json` for Arabic improvements)
4. **Make your improvements** while keeping the JSON structure intact
5. **Test your changes** by running the app
6. **Submit a pull request** with your improvements

#### Translation Guidelines

- Keep translations **concise and natural** in your language
- Maintain the **same tone** as the English version (friendly and professional)
- Test translations in the app to ensure they **fit the UI properly**
- For technical terms (like "KWGT", "KLWP"), keep them as-is unless there's a widely accepted translation
- Use **gender-neutral language** where possible
- Follow your language's **capitalization conventions**

#### Translation File Structure

Each translation file contains these main sections:
- `navigation` - Bottom navigation labels
- `wallpapers` - Wallpaper-related strings
- `wallpaperDetails` - Wallpaper details screen
- `widgetDetails` - Widget details screen
- `widgets` - Widget-related strings
- `depthWalls` - Depth wallpaper strings
- `favorites` - Favorites screen
- `settings` - Settings screen
- `aboutUs` - About us screen
- `common` - Common strings used throughout the app
